# Welcome

This project creates a package for OpenTAP to configure and execute Iperf (https://iperf.fr/) tests between a Iperf3 client and server.
The plugin inherits from the SSH plugin (https://gitlab.com/OpenTAP/Plugins/keysight/sshsteps) and reuses the connection config and setup.
This is an educational project meant to show to to inherit from existing projects to reuse and extend on basic functionalities for use in a specific plugin.
